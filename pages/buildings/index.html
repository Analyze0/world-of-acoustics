    The Kimmel Center is a large performing arts venue in Philadelphia it has several different concert halls located within it. The largest of which is the Verizon Hall, constructed for mainly orchestras and ensembles it contains a large pipe organ placed in the ceiling of the venue. There are also reverberation chambers located inside the east and west walls of the auditorium to amplify the sounds of the orchestra, they work by having a double layered wall with a few feet of space between them allowing sound waves to echo within them producing more depth and amplification in the sound. The impressive size of the hall also contributes to the quality of the acoustics within the hall.

  <h1 class="head">National Statuary Hall</h1>
  <p class="p about">
    The National Statuary Hall in Washington, DC is somewhat known for its ellipse shaped Hall. This ellipse shape changes how sound works within the Hall. If there are two people standing on very specific spots within the Hall they could hear each other whisper. This is because of the ellipse shape which makes it so that sound from any angle will always bounce off of the walls and hit the other person.
